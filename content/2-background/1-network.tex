\section{Network}
Devices that are connected with each other form a network. In order to connect to another device the address of the other node has to be known. To transfer data between devices the \gls{ip} has been introduced. Each device has a unique address inside the network which is called \gls{ip}-Address. The IP-Address can be assigned either by a \gls{isp}, a \gls{dhcp} Server or it can have a static one in a local environment. 
Data is transmitted in form of IP-Packets. The IP-Packet has the IP-Address of the sender and of the receiver and next to other fields the actual payload \cite{roberts}.

To transfer an IP-Packet from one device to another a router is needed. A router connects two networks and is responsible to route packets inside the local network or to forward them to the another network as described by \citet{shuler2002}.
Each device is registering itself at the router which is storing the IP-Address in a routing table. All devices known to the router are representing the local network. 

When the router receives an IP-Packet it looks up the receiver IP-Address in its routing table and is then forwarding the packet to the receiver when an entry exists.
When no entry exists, the packet is forwarded to another network. The router of the other network is taking care of it. The process is repeated by the next router until some router knows the receiver.
To prevent infinite hopping of IP-Packets each packet has a \gls{ttl}. The \gls{ttl} is decreased on each hop. When it reaches zero it is not forwarded anymore. 

To enable a reliable and secure way how packets are transmitted, several protocols are needed which handle, for example, packet loss, encryption and ensuring the correct order of received packets. 
To provide a common basis, the \gls{osi} model has been specified.

\subsection{OSI-Model}
\blockquote{The purpose of this Reference Model of Open Systems Interconnection is to provide a common basis [...] of systems interconnection, while allowing existing standards to be placed into perspective with the overall Reference Model} as specified by \citet{ISO1064-osi-model}. Seven abstract layers are specified and each of them provides functionality without depending on other layers. This means that a layer is transparent, thus implementation details are hidden from other layers and an interface is exposed to access it.

Data that is received by a device runs through all layers starting at layer one and ending at layer seven, where it will be consumed by an application. Just as the data is processed on receipt, the same steps have to be taken before it can be emitted, but in reverse order. This means data enters at layer seven and leaves the device in form of bits at layer one.
The seven layers of the OSI-Model are shown in \cref{fig:osimodel}, explained by \citet{osi-model-explained} and briefly summarised in the following.

\subsubsection{Application Layer}
Incoming data\newline
Device applications like browsers, email clients, calenders,... are interacting with this layer. The application layer provides an interface that comes from the underlying protocol like \gls{http} for Browser applications or \gls{smtp} for E-Mail applications. The data is in a consumable state and it is up to the application what to do with it.

Outgoing data\newline
Similar as for incoming data the application layer is also the entry point for device applications to send data using the protocol of the application layer like \gls{http}. 


\subsubsection{Presentation Layer}
Incoming data\newline
Preparing the data and making it consumable for the application layer is the task of the data layer. 
Hence, data has to be decrypted when it is encrypted, decompressed and put into the right format by decoding it.

Outgoing data\newline
Outing data can be encrypted, compressed and encoded by this layer.

\subsubsection{Session Layer}
Keeping the session and connection between two connected devices is one of the responsibilities of the session layer. It can also keep track of transmitted data and in case the connection is interrupted, it can continue where it left off e.g. when a file transfer is interrupted the file does not be re-transmitted from the first byte. 

\subsubsection{Transport Layer}
Incoming segments\newline
The transport layer is responsible for reassembling incoming segments and putting them into the right order, for error handling e.g. deal with lost packets and to determine the optimal connection speed how to communicate with the other. 
The two main protocols are \gls{tcp} and \gls{udp}.

Outgoing data\newline
Data that is sent is segmented into smaller chunks and further processed by the underlying protocol, e.g. \gls{tcp} adds a sequence number to each segment.

\subsubsection{Network Layer}
Incoming packets\newline
Incoming Packets are forwarded towards the meant receiver when the device is not the actual receiver. Otherwise packets are reassembled into segments and handed over to the transport layer.

Outgoing segments\newline
For outgoing segments the network layer is responsible for creating packets and routing them towards its destination.
The well known \gls{ip} is operating on this level. Segments provided by transport layer are segmented into packets. Each packet gets a \gls{ip} packet header that contains the address of the sender, the address of the receiver, a \gls{ttl}, the protocol with its version and other fields \cite{rfc791-ip}.

\subsubsection{Data Link Layer}
Incoming frames\newline
Tasks of this layer involve segmenting packets into frames and transmitting them within the same network.
Common networking components that are operating on this level are switches, hubs and network interface cards \cite{simoneau2006}.

Outgoing packets\newline
Packets received from the network layer are segmented into frames 

\subsubsection{Physical Layer}
The physical layer is the layer where the actual transport happens on a physical connection in form of electrical or optical signals.
Outgoing frames are transformed into bits (0,1) which can be represented as an electrical or optical signal.
Incoming bits are reassembled into frames and handed over to the data link layer.

\subsection{Overlay Network}

\begin{figure}[htb!]

\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{graphics/physical-vs-overlay-network.pdf}
\caption{Physical and overlay network example}
\label{fig:overlay}
\end{figure}

An overlay network is constructed on top of the physical network. Devices that are connected with each other form the physical network, while the overlay network is constructed on top of it. The overlay network only cares about who is part of the network and not how the partner is reachable. 
While the physical network has physical links between devices, the overlay network makes usage of virtual edges to connect devices that are actually not connected with each other. For the virtual edges the overlay network uses indirect connections. That means when \textit{A} is connected to \textit{B} and \textit{B} is connected to \textit{C}, the overlay network allows \textit{A} to send data to \textit{C} via \textit{B}.
\cref{fig:overlay} shows a sample physical network and its derived sample overlay network.

As the underlying physical network is transparent to the developer, the overlay network offers a huge design flexibility. The developer is free to chose her own network topology and protocol to use e.g. \gls{tcp} or \gls{udp}. However, the developer is responsible to maintain the virtual edges. This means when a device leaves the network, the overlay network has to be updated accordingly e.g. establish a replacement edge.

\subsection{Overlay Network Topologies}
The most common overlay network topologies are shown in \cref{fig:overlay-topologies}. In a centralised topology all devices are connected to one central device. A typical centralised example is the internet. The central device is a server and all other devices exchange information with that device. One of the advantages of this topology is that the provider has full control over it. Thus, the provided information is always up to date and the provider can control who has access to it. However, a centralised network can not grow endlessly, but only as big as the central device can handle the traffic. Also it is a single point of failure, because when it crashes the service can not be used anymore.

\begin{figure}[htb!]

    \subfloat[Centralised]{\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{graphics/overlay-network-centralised.pdf} \label{fig:overlay-topologies-a}}
    \subfloat[Hierarchical]{\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{graphics/overlay-network-hierarchical.pdf} \label{fig:overlay-topologies-b}}
	\subfloat[Decentralised]{\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{graphics/overlay-network-decentralised.pdf} \label{fig:overlay-topologies-c}}
	\caption{Common overlay network topologies}
\label{fig:overlay-topologies}
\end{figure}

A more scale-able and robust approach is the hierarchical overlay topology (\cref{fig:overlay-topologies-b}). The root node is still a single point of failure. Yet, when a child node crashes, it does not affect the whole network but only its children. By implementing load balancing strategies, a hierarchical network also scales better because the workload can be distributed among child nodes.

To get rid of the single point of failure, a decentralised overlay topology has to be used (\cref{fig:overlay-topologies-b}). In contrast to the previous mentioned topologies, the decentralised one is completely unstructured and anyone can join. Also nodes can connect to any other node in the network. However, as every node can be connected with any otehr node, the network is hard to manage. The process of nodes joining and leaving the network is called \textit{Churn} \cite[\S1]{stutzbach_rejaie_2006} and is a challenging part of decentralised networks.
