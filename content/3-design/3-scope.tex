\section{Scope Definition}

Due to limited time and resources of this project, the scope shall be reduced to focus on features of importance. Although these may contradict the requirements...TODO

\begin{itemize}
    \item Any user must be able to transmit video to \textit{k} other users.
    \item One producer and \textit{k} consumers form what is to be called a room. Any room must only support one concurrent stream (one–to–many).
    \item Users need not be able to discover all other users in their room and video streams should be broadcast to anyone in the room.
    \item Methods to ensure message authenticity and user identity shall be included in the design, but need not be fully implemented.
\end{itemize}
