\section{Design Considerations}

Up to this point, the reader has learned about multiple popular video streaming services. There is a wide range of specialisations, ranging from gaming\footnote{Twitch.

URL: {https://appear.in}}. Although marketing strategies and business models vary, their technological requirements boil down to two categories: 1) few channels broadcasting to large audiences and 2) smaller groups where every user contributes a live feed.
In a different sector, \gls{b2b} service providers offer complete video streaming solutions to companies and developers. They provide \glspl{sdk} and host all necessary infrastructure for their customers\footnote{Bambuser. URL: {https://bambuser.com}}\footnote{SimpleWebRTC. URL: {https://www.simplewebrtc.com}}.

When developing a decentralised \gls{p2p} system, an open approach to software development and system design can only help the project succeed.
