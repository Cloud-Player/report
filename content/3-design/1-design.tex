\section{Design Considerations}

Up to this point, the reader has learned about multiple popular video streaming applications. There is a wide range of specialisations, ranging from gaming\footnote{Twitch. URL: {https://twitch.com}}, lip–syncing\footnote{TikTok. URL: {https://www.tiktok.com}}, social media\footnote{Houseparty. URL: {https://houseparty.com}} to conferencing\footnote{appear.in. URL: {https://appear.in}}. In a different sector, \gls{b2b} services offer complete video streaming solutions to companies and developers. They provide \glspl{sdk}\footnote{SimpleWebRTC. URL: {https://www.simplewebrtc.com}} and host all necessary infrastructure for video delivery and encoding\footnote{Bambuser. URL: {https://bambuser.com}}. What these offerings have in common, is that they rely on server–client infrastructure. User generated content is uploaded to servers, processed and distributed over \glspl{cdn}. Commonly, they use \gls{hls} and \gls{mpegdash} streaming to feed live video to clients. Even though their marketing strategies and business models vary, their technological requirements boil down to two categories: 1) few channels broadcasting to large audiences and 2) smaller groups where multiple users contribute a live feed.

In academia, there have been numerous efforts to move towards \gls{p2p} streaming networks \cite{TODO-ilmstream, coolstreaming, TODO-noch-eins}. Although proven to be applicable\cite{TODO-skype, TODO-etc}, these technologies are scarcely found in mass market products today with reasons being manifold and debatable. One prominent reason, this thesis is trying to challenge, is \textit{platform–dependency}. Many prior \gls{p2p} streaming implementations are requiring native applications as they need access to the \gls{ip} network stack. As browser \glspl{api} have matured, it has become feasible to build a platform–independent streaming network with \gls{webrtc}. With the browser as its runtime, it should work independently of device category or operating system. 

- advances in p2p and mesh networks
- kademlia
- torrent

- ipfs is also running on in the browser
- ipfs is good as a distributed file system but not suitable for realtime data
- webrtc is supported by all major browsers and support data transfer and media streaming
- webrtc muy complicado
- web applications do not have to be installed by user, thus no barrier for the user to join a distributed network 


This thesis has set out to develop a live video streaming application
When developing a decentralised \gls{p2p} system, an open approach to software development and system design can only help the project succeed.
