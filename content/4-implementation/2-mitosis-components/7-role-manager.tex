Orchestrating the roles is the main responsibility of the \lstinline|RoleManager| (\vref{fig:mit-roles})

The RoleManager receives \lstinline|onTick| and \lstinline|onMessage| calls from \lstinline|Mitosis-Core| and delegates them to all roles. Each role can act accordingly and execute tasks as described in \vref{sec:design-roles}.

Roles have responsibilities and desires. The rolemanager is contacting the roles whenever it receives a tick or a message so a role can execute its intention according to its belief and desire.
