\subsection{Architecture}
Based on the design and the the self imposed requirements an architecture has been designed how all the components shall work together.
First of all an over all architecture has been designed. The architecture defines the high level modules and how they should interact with each other. 
In the next step each module got their own architecture.

\subsubsection{Overall Architecture}
The overall architecture consists of the following modules
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mitosis-Core
    \item Simulation
    \item Visualisation
    \item \gls{cli}
    \item Symbiosis
\end{itemize}

Mitosis-Core is the main component which sets up the Peer-To-Peer mesh network.
