\section{Mitosis-Stream}
Mitosis-Stream is extending the Mitosis-Core with streaming functionality. While Mitosis-Core is responsible to set up an overlay network the Mitosis-Stream module is responsible to set up a \glsfirst{dag} to deliver video streams. The \gls{dag} is created over the existing overlay network.
