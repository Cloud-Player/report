This scenario shows how the video broadcast is propagated through the network. \claire is the peer who is starting a video stream (\vref{fig:filmstrips-broadcast-a}). 
She is selecting her two best neighbours and starts the connection negotiation process to open a WebRTC stream connection. 

By using the WebRTC ConnectionMeter she has measured that \alice and \bob are her best neighbours. They both accept the offer and reply with an answer. \claire establishes the connection and starts pushing the video stream to them (\vref{fig:filmstrips-broadcast-b}).

Subsequently, \alice and \bob are selecting their best neighbours to open a WebRTC stream connection to and rebroadcast the video stream from \claire. The process repeats until it has reached all peers. However, each peer accepts only one incoming WebRTC stream connection and is only opening two outgoing ones.
In \vref{fig:filmstrips-broadcast-c} \don receives a broadcast offer from multiple peers. As he already has an incoming stream connection from \alice, he is rejecting all further offers.

Peers that have been left behind during the push phase, receive \textit{Stream-Announcements} from their neighbours with information on their open connection capacity. \textit{p1803} has not been selected in the first phase but it receives a Stream-Announcement from his neighbours \claire, \don, \textit{p9808} and \textit{p1747}. \claire has no available connection slot, thus it can only select \don, \textit{p9808} and \textit{p1747}. It sends all of a WebRTC stream connection request to all of them. \textit{p9808} replies with an offer first, thus \textit{p1803} opens a connection to this peer.
