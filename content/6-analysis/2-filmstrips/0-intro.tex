\section{Micro Scenarios}
In order to demonstrate the inner workings of Mitosis, small scenarios have been set up. Each scenario is executed by the simulation and the visualisation is used to show the behaviour of the nodes. The scenarios are kept as simple as possible and each of them is only focusing on one sub-aspect of the inner workings.
